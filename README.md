# TermuxRootMods
TermuxRootMods is a Magisk module available on GitHub that enhances the Termux experience for rooted devices. This module offers several improvements:

- Root Shell Replacement: It replaces the default shell with bash, providing additional functionalities like the ability to clear the screen with Ctrl + L. This allows for a more convenient and familiar shell environment for users.

- Aliases Configuration: It adds a file named .aliases to the /sdcard/ directory. This file contains user-defined aliases that can streamline common commands and improve productivity within the Termux environment.

- Service Monitoring Script: Additionally, TermuxRootMods includes a bash script that enables users to monitor running services. This script provides insights into the currently active services, offering users better control and visibility over system processes.

These enhancements aim to optimize the usage of Termux on rooted devices, providing users with a more feature-rich and efficient command-line environment.
